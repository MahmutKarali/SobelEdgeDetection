The operator uses two 3×3 kernels which are convolved with the original image to calculate approximations of thederivatives - one for horizontal changes, and one for vertical. 

If we define A as the source image, and Gx and Gy are two images which at each point contain the horizontal and vertical derivative approximations, the computations are as follows:

where  here denotes the 2-dimensional convolution operation.



The x-coordinate is defined here as increasing in the "right"-direction, and the y-coordinate is defined as increasing in the "down"-direction. At each point in the image, the resulting gradient approximations can be combined to give the gradient magnitude, using:
